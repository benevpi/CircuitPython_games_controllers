Mostly because I think that the 'joypad' style design is uninspired and there are much better options possible. This is my attempt to find a more fun way of playing games.

I haven't done any schematics because I free-hand the circuits and make them up as I go along. That said, there're very simple and you should be able to infer them from the code.

I got a bunch of protoboard in the shape of gamepads made up. This includes a spot to solder a Pico. Version 1 also had space for two stemma QT connectos ,
